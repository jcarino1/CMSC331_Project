The four files go together:
    Game.java
    Deck.java
    Card.java

Main is located in the Game.java file and you need javac Game.java, javac Deck.ja\
va, javac Card.java to compile and java Game to run the game

The Game.java file produces a text file called Results.txt with the statistics of\
 the games.

The ReadFile.lua is the file that reads in the Results.txt file and computes the \
averages, and prints out everything.
